PureNet
PureNet's original intention is to provide site blocking for children, teenagers and special groups to protect their web browsing experience.
Mainly blocking pornographic, gambling, cult and other bad sites, will increase advertising shielding in the future
This is a practice project for me. There may be many problems. You are welcome to correct me.
If you want to add a blocked list, please submit to Issues.
